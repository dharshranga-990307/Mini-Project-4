Microsoft: Classifying Cybersecurity Incidents with Machine Learning

Objective-
To develop a machine Learning model that can accurately predict the triage grade of cybersecurity incidents(True positive(TP),Benign Positive(BP) and False Positive(FP)).

Scope of the Project-
Automating the triage process by accurately classifying cybersecurity incidents.
Enabling guided response systems to automatically suggest appropriate actions for different types of incidents, leading to quicker mitigation of potential threats.
Enhancing threat detection capabilities by incorporating historical evidence and customer responses into the triage process, which can lead to more accurate identification of true and false positives.
Improving the overall security posture of enterprise environments by reducing the number of false positives and ensuring that true threats are addressed promptly

Method- 
Data Preprocessing(Filling missing values and Feature Engineering),
Exploratory Data Analysis,
Model Building And Evaluation with Training Data,
Performing the Testing Data Analysis.

Models Used-
Decision Tree
Xgboost Classifier
Bagging Classifier

Metrics Used-
Accuracy
Confusion Matrix
Classification Matrix
Auc and ROC Curve
